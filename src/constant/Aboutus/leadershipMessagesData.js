      "We strongly support the adage of serving as the ‘Guide on Side’ rather that ‘Sage on Sage’. We believe in the philosophy of focusing on individual needs and involving students in the process of their learning. All students have innate potentialities and it is the basic role of educators to help them identify and build upon their strength. VPP CBSE is the gateway to the holistic development of the Students pursuing NCERT Syllabus.",
